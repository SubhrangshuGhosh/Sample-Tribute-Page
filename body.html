            <h2>About Marie Curie</h2>
            <p>
                Maria Salomea Sk≈Çodowska-Curie, known simply as Marie Curi, was a Polish and naturalised-French physicist and chemist who conducted pioneering research on radioactivity. She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, the first person to win a Nobel Prize
                twice, and the only person to win a Nobel Prize in two scientific fields. Her husband, Pierre Curie, was a co-winner of her first Nobel Prize, making them the first married couple to win the Nobel Prize and launching the Curie family legacy
                of five Nobel Prizes. She was, in 1906, the first woman to become a professor at the University of Paris.
